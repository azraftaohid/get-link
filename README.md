# Get Link
Get Link is truly a one-tap solution that lets you create shareable links for files on the internet. It's fast, lightweight, and easy to use — just gets the thing done; nothing else.
 - Original quality: photos along with any other types of files are shared without any level of compressions. 
 - Security: by default, links are generated with random, and unguessable characters — making it extremely hard for unintended users to find your files.
 - Expire: generated links automatically expire after 14 days. And then it will be deleted from the server forever.

## Usage
### Get Link

 1. Click on the __Upload file__ button from the _Home_ page. Then choose your desired file. or,
 1. Drag & drop your desired file into the __Upload file__ button area.
